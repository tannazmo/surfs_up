# Surf and Shake Shop Data Analysis
Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview of statistical analysis
To get the investors' backing, we needed to convince them that a surf & shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii will be a success, and the investors need some weather data to be able to determine that 

## Results
Investors have already looked at the whole last year's data and are now requiring more data specific to the months of June and December. This will be from all the years that the data had been gathered and not just one year.
We produced two statistical summaries about the weather temperatures of these two months as below:

![December_Temperature](/images/december-stats.png "December Temperature")

 - ***Average Temperature comparison:***
 
By looking at the average of temperature in June and comparing it to December, we can see that the change of weather temperature between summer and winter are not that different (around 75 degrees F for June and around 71 degrees F for the month of December) which means that surfing can be an all year activity in that island, if we only looked at the weather temperature.

 - ***Median Temperature comparison:***

Median of the temperatures gathered, in the month of June is 75 degrees F while for the month of December, it is 71 which means half of the recorded temperatures are above 71 degrees which is a very nice weather - temperature-wise - for surfing.

 - ***Minimum Temperature comparison:***

Now we would like to compare the coldest it has been recorded in the island of Oahu, that could make surfing uncomfortable to see if this is a seasonal business, but as our stat is showing it can get as cold as 64 in warmer months and as cold as 56 degrees F in the colder months, which is still a pretty comfortable weather for surfing.


## Summary
By only looking at the temperatures and compare a cold month and a warm month, we can determine that the climate year-round is pretty much moderate and comfortable for surfers to surf and also enjoy an ice-cream comparing the cold month and the warm.

**<ins>But what if it is warm but rainy?</ins>** To answer this question, we ran two additional queries to see how the weather could statistically be in terms of precipitation and we again compared June and December to get a better insight.

The precipitation data when looked at, along with the temperature statistics, can give the investors a more accurate insight about the possible success or failure of the proposed surf and shake shop.
